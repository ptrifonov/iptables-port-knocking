# Implementing port knocking with iptables

Port knocking is a security technique used to protect network services from unauthorized access or attack. It works by dynamically opening firewall ports on demand by first knocking on a sequence of ports in a specific order. Once the correct sequence of knocks is detected, the firewall rules are automatically modified to allow traffic to the requested service port.
